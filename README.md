# EDGARreader
Downloads 10K/10Q filings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.

Currently downloads appropriate files based on type of filing and its date uploaded to your computer's default Python directory ("C:\Python34\"). It is recommended that you change this address as needed.

Areas for improvements / Updates to come:
  1. Runtime not optimized; will be done in the future
  2. Ability to download filings up-to a certain date, not just filings that were uploaded "t" number of days ago
  3. Search function to lookup Central Index Key (CIK) for a specific company
  4. Ability to download  filings based on a company's CIK
