# EDGARreader
Downloads 10K/10Q filings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system. This repository is being used as a means to monitor progress; that is, work is unfinished and will be continuously updated.

Currently downloads appropriate files based on type of filing and its date uploaded to the computer's default Python directory ("C:\Python34\"). It is recommended to change this address as needed.

Areas for improvements / Updates to come:
  1. Runtime not optimized; will be done in the future
  2. Ability to download filings up-to a certain date, not just filings that were uploaded "t" number of days ago
  3. Search function to lookup Central Index Key (CIK) for a specific company
  4. Ability to download  filings based on a company's CIK
